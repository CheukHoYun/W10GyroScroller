# G10 Gyro Scroller

G10 Gyro Scroller is a lightweight Windows utility designed to enable smooth scrolling using the [PepperJobs W10 Air Remote](https://www.pepper-jobs.com/products/w10-gyro-smart-remote). With this tool, you can scroll by moving the mouse vertically while holding down the File Explorer button.

## Code Overview

- **main.cpp**  
  Reads the configuration file, installs the keyboard hook, creates the tray icon, and manages the main message loop.

- **KeyboardHook.cpp**  
  Implements a low-level keyboard hook to monitor key events. It detects when the Win and E keys are pressed together, intercepting further input and triggering callbacks to start or stop scrolling. You may edit this file to rebind the scrolling feature to a different key combination if you like to. 

- **MouseLocker.cpp**  
  Manages mouse locking during scrolling. It captures vertical mouse movement, calculates scrolling deltas, and feeds them into the smooth scrolling mechanism.

- **SmoothScroller.cpp**  
  Oversees smooth scrolling by gradually adjusting the scroll speed based on accumulated mouse movement. This functionality runs on a separate thread to ensure fluid performance.

- **TrayIcon.cpp**  
  Creates and manages the system tray icon. It also provides a right-click menu to adjust sensitivity settings and exit the application.

## How to Use

1. **Preparation**  
   - Compile the project to produce the executable (.exe) file.
   - Ensure the configuration file (`config.cfg`) is located in the same folder as the executable. The file should contain a single line in the format:  
     `sensitivity=<value>`
   - Alternatively, if you prefer not to compile the program yourself, you can download the precompiled .zip file from the [release page](https://github.com/CheukHoYun/W10GyroScroller/releases/tag/Release), which includes both the executable and the configuration file.

2. **Execution**  
   - Run the executable to start the application. It will automatically install the necessary hooks and display a tray icon for easy access.
   - You may now move your mouse up/down to scroll through pages while holding the "File Explorer" (Win+E) button.
   - You may change the sensitivity value in `config.cfg` to allow faster / slower scrolling. A restart of the program is required for it to take effect. 

3. **Auto-Start Setup**  
   - For convenience, you can add the executable and the configuration file to your systemâ€™s startup folder so that the application launches automatically when Windows starts.
   - **Startup folder location (for the current user):**  
     `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
